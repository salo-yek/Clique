# Clique
Clique is a highly secure, open-source AI gateway and terminal-based assistant built in C#. It seamlessly bridges the gap between local language models (via Ollama) and cloud-based models (like Mistral API). Featuring a minimalisic command-line interface powered by Spectre.Console, Clique operates in both standard Chat and advanced Agent modes. As an Agent, it supports sophisticated tool-calling capabilities including local file system manipulation, shell command execution, web searching, image analysis, and mathematical calculations. Security is a first-class citizen—Clique implements a robust permission system that prompts users before executing potentially dangerous actions and securely encrypts API keys. Whether you want a quick chat or a capable AI developer assistant right in your terminal, Clique provides a fast, customizable, and safe environment for your daily AI workflows.
